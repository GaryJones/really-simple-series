Really Simple Series allows you to turn normal blog categories into their own post series.

## Description

Other series plugins create a custom taxonomy where each series is a term. Most people probably don't need a new taxonomy. Really Simple Series lets you turn any category into its own series with the click of a checkbox.

To turn on a series, you simple go to the *edit category* screen and check the box to enable Really Simple Series. Once you do, the plugin will automatically reverse the order of all posts in that category so that the oldest show up first. It will also automatically insert a list of all posts in the series at the bottom of each post in that category / series.

## Options

There is no configuration of this plugin. Just activate, enable a category for Really Simple Series, and enjoy.

You just have to click within the edit *category* screen to enable a series. There are no other options. There is a shortcode available called 
`[rsseries cat="148"]`, where "`148`" is a specific category ID, that can be used to display a series of your choice. Do not use the `[rsseries]`` shortcode without a category parameter, or it may show all of your blog posts.
